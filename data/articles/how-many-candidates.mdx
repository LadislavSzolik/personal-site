My journey to become a User Experince Designer (UX) was not that smooth. But eventually I managed and learned few thing along the way. 

Here is a short list of my initial assumptions. Plus comments about how I see things today:
- with developer background I will get a better chance to get into UX => it all depends on the position, company, hiring manager, etc. Actually I know people with Business Administration background in UX. 
- the hiring team reviews my portfolio => haha....after 50 interviews, it was very seldom to notice that they saw my work. I don't have a final answer why, it has to do with the available time what the team has, the high number of applicants and the fact that a lot of people are faking design portfolios...
- if I get hired as UX Designer, I don't need to explain or proof myself in office => well, you might be surpirsed. This profession in Switzerland is still relatively new. The question is, does it worth to win the company trust or to search for other job.
- it is enough to have a good resume and a portfolio to stand out  => for one cool UX position there are around 100 candidates. Now, if somebody goes with the official way (applying for the position through the job portal), that person gotta be really badass to stand out.

... these points came to my mind. There are many ways how you can get into UX and I think the web is full of those ways. I thought it make sense to share also the dark side, or at least not that fun realities about this profession.
