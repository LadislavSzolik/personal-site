It is sad to see a talented developer getting lost in a corporate structure, never gets a chance to express herself. Or others who follow false visions. 

These days I always imagine a fully remote comapany what I run with fellow passionate people. 

We have the infrastructure and connectivity which cost almost nothing. I believe it is possible to stand up and become the leader and creator. 
At least this is what I am trying to do. What I can't understand, why is it so difficult? What I am doing wrong?
