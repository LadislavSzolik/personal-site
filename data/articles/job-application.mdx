In 2017 I had a crazy idea: let's move from software engineering to ux design because it sounded like a cool idea. 

After a bunch of self study and courses I wanted to do the job interviews right, so I studied how others prepare their portfolio, CV etc. I was prepared... 

After around 50-60 rejections I started to see that things did not work so easily as I thought they will. So many videos, articles and books with guarantee to succeed and yet non of them worked for me. I could not get even into the second round. I did not know how to do the interview properly.

In the end I decided to use the interviews as a place to practice, I sent my applications to all companies with a matching role I am looking for. If I wanted to rock on an interview, I needed to be good at it. I told the story of my resume so many times to so many different people, that I became fluent.

The thing is, it is super difficult to test if you are a good fit for a job/company/team. They can test if you can 'pass the interview test'. Luckily applications are for free!
