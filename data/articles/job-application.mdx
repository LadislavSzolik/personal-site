summary: 'A note about my realisation regards job interviews'
---

In 2017 I had a crazy idea: let's move from software engineer to ux design because it sounded like a cool idea. 

I wanted to do it right, so I studied how others prepare their portfolio, CV etc. I was prepared... 

After around 50-60 rejections I started to see that things are not working as I thought they will. And it is true, how a random guy from US can show me how to get hired in here Switzerland? Too many differences...

In the end I used the interviews as a place to practice. I told the story of my resume, my portfolio so many times.

On an interview super difficult to test if you are a good fit for a job/company/team. They can test if you can pass the interview. With practice I could pass that interview, because job applications are for free!
