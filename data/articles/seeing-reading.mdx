In the recent years I spent many hours to read the greatest design books. I took notes from them like a good student. 

Now I finally got a real project to ship, I realized I can't use most of that knowledge. 

Also, I observed and collected so many well designed apps and websites. Recently I built something instead of reading about it, my learning was exponential. I can recommend it to you!
