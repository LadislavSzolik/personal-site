summary: 'After I read a design book I feel smart until I have to solve a real problem. Then I realize, the book was not enough.'

In the recent years I spent many hours to read the greatest design books. I have taken great notes like a good student. In office I used to even present these learnings.

Recently I got a side project where it striked me how much practical knowledge I am missing to ship the solution. It is good to know about design principles, but when a client wants a site in 2 weeks, it is about the ability to build something that works and release it.

After this project I decided to switch to a hybrid approach. I start with a project what I want to ship and I pick up the knowledge on the way.
