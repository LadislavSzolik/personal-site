I have this vision of being able to boot up my laptop and create a business. Without investors or large teams.

This idea of getting investors slowing the business down, as they will need to spend effort on cathering the guys with money, instead of spending on the business itself.

Anyways, I struggle with this topic. I got not good enough idea. I believe this is partially because the story of running a business is messed up. Difficult to find people who really want to share their knowledge and experience.

The other thing is being satisfied with what I already have. Or maybe nothing really matters to me?
