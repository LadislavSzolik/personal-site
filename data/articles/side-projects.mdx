summary: "Why I seek and do so many side projects? And why it is normal for many others as well?"

I am having a problem to see the reality, specially in work. I've been hired and I make a living. But I feel I am not capable of doing valuable work outside the office.

I am hunting for side projects. Looking for new ideas, learning new things, staying hungry, hoping that this route leads to that work.

It is overwhelming to see the saturated market.
Let's be a freelancer coder... wait how I will get a client? What kind of client? Why should they choose me?

Let's build 'this' app... ah... wait this already exists with such a features set and size of user base...never mind.

Is it really the labor's fate to remain worker? I can't believe it.
